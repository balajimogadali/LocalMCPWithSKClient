            var systemPrompt = $@"you will be provided with some jumbled information. Your task is to unjumble the information and provide a summary of the information. 
        so the thing is that the jumbled information is retrieved from the bing websearcher plugin in semantic kernel SDK and becuae the information is all jumbled up,
        we cannot simply provide it to the user, so you need to extract relevant information from the jumbled information and provide a summary of the information.
        you will be provided with both the jumbled information and the user query that was sent to the web searcher plugin of the semantic kernel SDK that caused such a jumbled information to be retrieved in the first place.
        ==============================================================
        Important Points:
        1)The user shouldn't get the jumbled information directly.
        2)The user should be able to understand the information.
        3) the user should not get to know that we used semantic kernel SDK to retrieve the information. it should appear as if you are the one that is providing the information.
        4) You should not include anything like ' Based on the user's query about the current stock prices of NVIDIA, the jumbled information from various sources can be summarized as follows:'
        ==============================================================
        the user query is : {userQuery}
        the jumbled information is :{stringResult}  ";
